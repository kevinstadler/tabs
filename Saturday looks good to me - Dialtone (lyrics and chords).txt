Saturday looks good to me - Dialtone
====================================

There's a tab online that claims the entire song is just A and F#m, but this one
here should be more accurate. I saw them live on their last tour in 2008 and
looked at what Fred was playing - I am definitely sure about the F#m, Bm and D,
the A is obvious but I can't remember whether he plays it open or barré - the E
is a guess by me but it sounds very correct, but maybe also played as barré on
the 7th (like almost all other chords, especially the Bm > C#m > D > E sliding)

I really love the intro to the song that is on the LP, so I'm posting the 
lyrics for that as well (apart from the two/tool-wave stuff which I just can't
understand). Fred posted a blog about some slgtm songs where he sort-of explains
the intro and you can also get old demo versions of other songs there:

Have fun!


Ok, we're gonna play our brand new song
And I've been around here for a little while
Checking things out, looking at people
I see people every day, see people all over the world, all over the place
They got things like, you know: telephones, televisions, letters, beepers,
pagers, calling-cards, all sorts of things
And this song is about how regardless of these things, despite these really
beautiful technological advances, it's sometimes still very difficult to get
through to one another
Is everybody ready? Ok one, two, one two three four


           A               F#m             A                F#m
Beside the drum kit in the basement, I was trying to get to sleep

             A                      F#m               Bm          E
I heard your voice come through the floorboards on my answering machine

           Bm                 F#m               D                E
But by the time I reached the phone's ring, the only thing still singing was the

A        F#m A F#m A F#m A F#m
dialtone

I couldn't find you in my dreams, so I went out into the night
I heard you talking somewhere soft, your voice bounced off a satellite
But by the time I reached the place where the sound originated
You were gone

               Bm              F#m              D                 E
Oh but I smell summer in those letters that you sprayed with your perfume
              Bm                    F#m              D               E
I breath your breath and I was left swaying with the curtains in the room
        Bm                  F#m                  D           E
And the knowledge you would leave me beneith the angry April moon
               A     F#m A F#m A F#m A F#m
Where you first found me

You've got one too many lovers but you're still my only friend
And you've got more secret admirers than there are snakes in the garden
But by the time you finish kissing, huh, whoever's coming round hissing
You're spitting out poison

Oh and all the people have their reasons
For the things that they think they have to do
But none of the reasons you keep speaking sound anything like the truth, well
Each one sounds like a composite, each one sounds like a new excuse for letting go

            C#m
Well so let go
              Bm~
If all that's left is letting go
       Bm                                 E
As the x-ray clearly shows this thing was broken long ago
         C#m
The bars will close
        Bm
And the ashtrays overflow

Bridge:
Bm Bm/C#m D (2 bars)
E (3 bars) E D# D C#m (1 stroke each)

Bm                  F#m                  D                 E
I won't be there on Thursday night but I hope you all have fun
You may not recognize my absence but I won't be the only one
Who's going missing from your party as the stitches come undone, uh-oh-uh

A F#m (3x)
A D A~
