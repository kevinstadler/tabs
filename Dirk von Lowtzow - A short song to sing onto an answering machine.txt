Dirk von Lowtzow - A short song to sing onto an answering machine
=================================================================

Translation of the German original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MYNMAc8TxA

All the things you said last evening
I now see them, strangely clear / Still ring true to my ear
Certain things will linger with us
Like the leaves from yesteryear

On the street outside my window
Where the first trees are in bloom
Certain things get ever harder
The more pains you take to do â€™em
